                <p>We are a traveling creperie known for the delicious waffles on the stick and traditional crepes. Always on the road, from one side to the other, the well-known pink minivan is located in the Algarve during the summer season and in Lisbon in the winter.</p>

                <p>Our waffles are characterized by their light and wet mass inside and crispy outside. They are stuffed and the choice of taste is at the discretion of the customer. In addition they come clinging to a toothpick to be easy to eat in progress without getting dirty.</p>
                
                <p>There are many traditional crepes, but ours are special. With much work and study we have discovered our secret recipe, a balanced mass with ingredients in the right proportion. It is characterized by being soft, thin and tender. They are served rolled with the filling inside making it practical to eat.</p>
                
                <p>We even have mini pancakes and churritos without fry. And to accompany these specialties we have our drinks, such as hot chocolate, various teas, cappuccino, latte macchiato, lemonade or morangada and of course, a ginginha of Óbidos to complete this appetizing menu.</p>

                <p>Catarina Lourenço and David Simões, graduated in Food Production in Catering at the Superior School of Hospitality and Tourism of Estoril.</p>

                <p>We worked in several hotel and restaurant kitchens. Highlights include the Bon Bon in Carvoeiro with a Michelin star, the 100 Ways in Lisbon from Chef Ljubomir, the Vila Vita Parc Resort & Spa in Porches, the Cascais Miragem Hotel in Cascais, the Pestana Colombos Premium in Porto Santo, among others.</p>
                
                <p>There was an enthusiasm for starting our project. We were fascinated when we learned how to make bonbons with Chef Nelson Felix in the Pastry Chair. We decided to create a brand of candy. There was the Good (bonbon), two people who came together to do something good, so good that it is twice as good! We tested combinations and created incredible fillings hidden in the thin, crisp, crisp chocolate coating. 
                We quickly started gaining customers, many orders came in for a small, handcrafted and rather elementary production capacity. Some complications appeared with the inability to invest in machines, air-conditioned production space and employees.</p>
                
                <p>Summer was approaching, a very hot time to work the chocolate. In a conversation with friends, we talked about buying a Street Food van. We left the chocolates temporarily. New ideas began to emerge. We bought the van and then we decorated and arranged to our taste with the help of the company Porquê Design.</p>
                
                <p>We decided to create something different and innovative, the original waffles stuffed in the toothpick appeared. The name was kept, but the concept changed. The need for a food that was practical to eat in progress led us to the creation of the waffle stuck in the toothpick. We unveiled this concept of Street Food in the Summer of 2017 in the Riverine Zone of Portimão. 
                We quickly began to gain praise for the quality of our masses, eventually giving rise to our slogan "who proves more".</p>
